This repository contains files describing the procedure for scrapping tweets from Twitter and storing these in a CSV file using Python. Our search was focused and restricted to 1,000 tweets containing the hashtag #brexit. The data was collected on 18.11.2017 at around 14:30. Futhermore, we provide a preliminary descriptive analysis of the colledted data. Finally, a map of all scrapped tweets can be found under the following link: https://goo.gl/ri7QKN
