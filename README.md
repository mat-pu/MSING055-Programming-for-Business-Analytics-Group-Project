This repository contains files describing the procedure for scrapping tweets from Twitter and storing these in a CSV file using Python. Our search was focused and restricted to 1,000 tweets in eight iterations containing the word 'brexit' together with another keyword regarding the job market. Futhermore, we provide the extracted CSV file as well as a preliminary descriptive analysis of the collected data. Finally, a map (creating with Google Fusion Tables) of all scrapped tweets can be found under the following link: https://goo.gl/zbeijK
