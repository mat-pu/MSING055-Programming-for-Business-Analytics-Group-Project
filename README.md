This repository contains files describing the procedure for scrapping Brexit-related tweets from Twitter and storing these in a CSV file using Twitter API / Tweepy and Python. Our search was focused and restricted to 2,000 tweets in English language containing the word 'brexit' between 20/11/2017 and 26/11/2017. Futhermore, we provide the extracted CSV file as well as a preliminary descriptive and sentiment analysis of the collected data. Finally, a map (creating with Google Maps) of all scrapped tweets can be found under the following link: https://goo.gl/WxWt6t
